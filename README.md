# IMC_Challenge
I took part in the IMC Prosperity Challenge, where you had 5 rounds of a trading contest, each, expect the last round, consisted of a manual and an algorithic trading challenge. This is the code I commited for Round 4. Over a thousand teams composed of up to 5 person, from all over the world, competed against each other and I managed to secure the 99th place for me.
